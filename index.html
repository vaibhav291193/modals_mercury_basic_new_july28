                This is just a demonstration. If it were a real application, it would
                provide a message telling whether the entered address is valid.
            </p>
            <p>
                For demonstration purposes, this dialog has a lot of text. It demonstrates a
                scenario where:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The first interactive element, the help link, is at the bottom of the dialog.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If focus is placed on the first interactive element when the dialog opens, the
                    validation message may not be visible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the validation message is visible and the focus is on the help link, then
                    the focus may not be visible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When the dialog opens, it is important that both:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The beginning of the text is visible so users do not have to scroll back to
                            start reading.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The keyboard focus always remains visible.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There are several ways to resolve this issue:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Place an interactive element at the top of the dialog, e.g., a button or link.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make a static element focusable, e.g., the dialog title or the first block of
                    text.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Please
                <em>
                    DO NOT
                </em>
                make the element with role dialog focusable!
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The larger a focusable element is, the more difficult it is to visually
                    identify the location of focus, especially for users with a narrow field of view.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The dialog has a visual border, so creating a clear visual indicator of focus
                    when the entire dialog has focus is not very feasible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Screen readers read the label and content of focusable elements. The dialog
                    contains its label and a lot of content! If a dialog like this one has focus, the
                    actual focus is difficult to comprehend.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In this dialog, the first paragraph has
                <code>
        tabindex=
        <q>
          -1
        </q>
      </code>
                . The first
                paragraph is also contained inside the element that provides the dialog description, i.e., the element that is referenced
                by
                <code>
        aria-describedby
      </code>
                . With some screen readers, this may have one negative
                but relatively insignificant side effect when the dialog opens -- the first paragraph
                may be announced twice. Nonetheless, making the first paragraph focusable and setting
                the initial focus on it is the most broadly accessible option.
